🌍 Comprehensive COVID-19 Data Analysis & Modeling 🦠
Welcome to the Comprehensive COVID-19 Data Analysis and Modeling repository! This project focuses on analyzing and modeling the spread and impact of COVID-19 using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to provide insightful data-driven predictions and visualizations to understand the trends, patterns, and factors that influenced the pandemic. 📊

🚀 Key Features: 
- Data Collection 📚: Aggregating global COVID-19 datasets from reliable sources like WHO, John Hopkins University, and government portals.<br>
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 🧹: Handling missing data, normalizing time series, and preparing the dataset for analysis.<br>
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍: Visualizing and understanding trends (cases, recoveries, deaths) through interactive plots and statistical analysis.<br>
- Evaluation & Metrics 📈: Analyzing model accuracy, precision, recall, and more to ensure reliable predictions.<br>
- Interactive Dashboards 🖥️: Creating dynamic visualizations to allow real-time monitoring of trends.


🔧 Tech Stack:
- Languages: Python 🐍<br>
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly<br>
- ML Models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, ARIMA, and more<br>
- Visualization Tools: Plotly Dash for interactive visualizations
