🌍 Comprehensive COVID-19 Data Analysis & Modeling 🦠
Welcome to the Comprehensive COVID-19 Data Analysis and Modeling repository! This project focuses on analyzing and modeling the spread and impact of COVID-19 using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to provide insightful data-driven predictions and visualizations to understand the trends, patterns, and factors that influenced the pandemic. 📊

🚀 Key Features:
Data Collection 📚: Aggregating global COVID-19 datasets from reliable sources like WHO, John Hopkins University, and government portals.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 🧹: Handling missing data, normalizing time series, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍: Visualizing and understanding trends (cases, recoveries, deaths) through interactive plots and statistical analysis.
Predictive Modeling 🧠: Applying machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Time-Series Models) to predict the future spread and trends of COVID-19.
Evaluation & Metrics 📈: Analyzing model accuracy, precision, recall, and more to ensure reliable predictions.
Interactive Dashboards 🖥️: Creating dynamic visualizations to allow real-time monitoring of trends.
🔧 Tech Stack:
Languages: Python 🐍
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
ML Models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, ARIMA, and more
Visualization Tools: Plotly Dash for interactive visualizations
